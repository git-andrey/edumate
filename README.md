In today's fast-paced academic environment, students often struggle to manage their study materials, extract key insights, and prepare effectively for exams. Traditional methods of studying can be time-consuming and inefficient. EduMate was born out of the need to create a smarter, more efficient way to study. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, EduMate aims to revolutionize the way students interact with their study materials, making learning more engaging, personalized, and effective.

# What It Does
EduMate is an AI-powered study assistant designed to help students manage, analyze, and interact with their study materials in a more efficient way. Here's what it offers:
- **Upload Study Materials:** Easily upload your study materials (PDFs, text files) and store them in a centralized database for quick access.
